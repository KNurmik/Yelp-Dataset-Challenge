# Yelp Dataset Challenge

Yelp is a business directory service and crowd-sourced review forum.

This report aims to answer the following questions about all businesses in the dataset:

- What sort of businesses are present in the dataset, i.e. where are they located and what sort of industry do they belong to? Which of them tend to have bike parking available?

- Does a higher review count lead to a greater review rating?

For businesses located in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), we will attempt to answer:

- What sort of businesses of the dataset are in the GTA? Which franchises are most frequent?

- Are review count and rating related to the location of businesses?

- Is it true that for every Tim Hortons there is a Starbucks nearby? Which one of these chains has an advantage in the way they've placed their shops with respect to the other?

- Are most reviews written by a small group of users?

- Do people use similar language when writing reviews about Tim Hortons and Starbucks? Is this the case among users who have reviewed both chains?

- Can we detect fake reviews?
